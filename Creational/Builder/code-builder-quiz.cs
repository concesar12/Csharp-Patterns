/*Considerations for coding exercise
1. The root of the code chain looks is "public class"
2. After the root is given with the name of the parameter then a curly bracket is given next
3. Looks like root is always public.
4. only if the in add field we add the name and the type
5. after each add field we place a semicolon ";"
6. we finish with a curly braces

Algorithm
1. string root
2. dictionary field
3. class CodeBuilder 

root = "public"
